The spectest is a forked project of [steinfletcher/apitest](https://github.com/steinfletcher/apitest), including side projects of apitest, all managed as go-spectest organization. The spectest will have more documentation generation capabilities than apitest and will have more mocks on AWS.  
  
The reason for the fork is to eliminate obsolete functions in apitest, remove bugs, and fix side projects broken by adding functionality to apitest.
There is no guarantee that spectest will perform maintenance with more dedication than the original apitest. So if you find a bug, please consider reporting it to the apitest project as well.  

The differences between Spectest and Apitest can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/go-spectest/spectest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Please refer to it for more details.
  
I respect [the original author (steinfletcher)](https://github.com/steinfletcher) who created a great project.
